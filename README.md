# Stock-Momentum-Dashboard---yfinance/Excel/Yahoo-Version
This program allows you to input a list of stock or ETF ticker symbols into an Excel spreadsheet. For each ticker entered the program will calculate the annualized percentage price changes over the previous 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.
If you optionally also input a purchase date and purchase price for a ticker, the program will calculate the annualized percentage price change since the purchase date.
This gives a handy, colour-coded overview of stocks that have a positive price trend over time, versus stocks whose prices are turning negative or have mixed results. 
I think of these results as a momentum dashboard for stock/ETF prices.
The dashboard uses an Excel spreadsheet for you to input your choice of ticker symbols and for easy display of the annualized percentage price changes over the above periods.
